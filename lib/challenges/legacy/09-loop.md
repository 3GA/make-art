Loops are ways to make things happen multiple times without having to do any more work.

---

You can define a `for` loop:

```
for i in [1 .. 5]
    circle i
```

This will perform the `circle` command 5 times with the size, `i`, increasing by one each time.

---

Increase the number repeats in the loop to 10.
