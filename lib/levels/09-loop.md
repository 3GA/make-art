Loops are ways to make things happen multiple times without having to do any more work.

---

You can define a `for` loop:

```
for i in [1..5]
    circle i
```

This will perform the `circle` command 5 times with the radius increasing by one each time the command is run

Make the caterpillar move across the screen by increasing the number of times that the body is repeated.
