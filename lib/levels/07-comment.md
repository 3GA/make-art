Comments are parts of the code that don't do anything.

They are useful to help you understand the code, or to neutralise a spell.

---

If you add a `#` symbol at the start of a spell, it will become commented, for example:

```
# This will draw a circle:
circle 20

# This won't draw anything:
# circle 20
```

---

Try removing the `#` symbols and enable the spells in the next example, and see what happens!

---

Remember to remove **ALL** of the `#`'s
